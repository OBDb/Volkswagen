## About Volkswagen

Volkswagen is one of the world's largest automobile manufacturers, headquartered in Wolfsburg, Germany. The company was founded with the mission of creating affordable cars for the average person - literally translating to "People's Car" in German.

## Generations

### Early Years (1937-1945)

Volkswagen was founded in 1937 under the Nazi regime in Germany. The company's initial purpose was to produce an affordable vehicle that the average German family could afford, following Adolf Hitler's directive to Ferdinand Porsche to design a "people's car" (Volkswagen). This led to the development of what would later become the iconic Volkswagen Beetle (initially called the KdF-Wagen). During World War II, the company shifted production to military vehicles.

### Post-War Reconstruction (1945-1960)

After WWII, Volkswagen was saved from dismantling by British Army officer Major Ivan Hirst, who saw potential in the company. Under his initial supervision and later under the leadership of Heinz Nordhoff, Volkswagen began producing the Type 1 (Beetle) for civilian use. The Beetle became enormously successful, and Volkswagen established itself as a major automotive manufacturer. During this period, the company also introduced the Type 2 (Microbus/Transporter) in 1950.

### Expansion and Diversification (1960-1990)

Volkswagen expanded its lineup beyond the Beetle, introducing models like the Golf (1974), Passat (1973), and Polo (1975). The Golf in particular became a cornerstone product, replacing the Beetle as Volkswagen's core offering. During this period, Volkswagen also began acquiring other automotive brands, starting with Auto Union (later becoming Audi) in 1964. The company expanded globally with manufacturing facilities in multiple countries.

### Modern Era (1990-Present)

Volkswagen has grown into one of the world's largest automotive groups. The company continued its expansion strategy, acquiring brands such as SEAT, Å koda, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Porsche, forming the Volkswagen Group. The company pioneered technological advancements and developed platforms that could be shared across multiple brands and models. In recent years, Volkswagen has made significant investments in electric vehicles with its ID. series and faced challenges related to emissions standards and regulations. The company has committed to a future focused on electric mobility, with plans to transition much of its lineup to electric power in the coming years.
